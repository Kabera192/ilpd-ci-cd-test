Hi Claude,

I have been tasked with writing kubernetes config files for a project which has over 8 microservices. For context, the project is for a school and the microservices include the following:

- auth-service: Handles everything authentication related.
- academic-service: Handles everything academics oriented such as grades, assignments and the like.
- registration-service: Handles everything to do with intake applications and so on.
- hostel-service: The school also has a hotel and so this would handle management of that business process.
- notificaiton-service: Handles everything to do with notifications.
- payment-service: Handles everything to do with payment of tuition and other fees.
- service-registry: Contains the Eurreka service registry
- gateway-service: Has the Springboot API Gateway that redirects calls to the appropriate service.

Currently, the way the project is working, when the devs push code to github, some automated process builds the project, creates a docker image/images for each microservice and somehow they are accessible on the testing server. I don't know this is all working to be honest. What is confusing me is why do they need kubernetes? What is it going to solve?

Secondly, do I need namespaces for the kubernetes configuration?

Third, can you explain to me what kubernetes components I will have to create in order to have this working.

Last, for now, I think we should use config maps and secrets, does that mean that I will have to go into the application.properties of each microservice and add the environment variables inside it? How will the environment variables I set in these config files going to be related to those in application.properties for each springboot project?
